# Module 05 Challenge

## Description

- I created an event planner labeled with normal business hours (9am-5pm) indicating hours in grey as past time blocks, red for the current time block, and green as future time blocks to ensure events are recorded to keep track of my busy schedule!
- This planner was created to record and keep track of events into local storage, so that I can refer back to my scheduled events.
- The color-coded time blocks are labeled in order to make reading the planner easier to diffrentiate the events in accordance to the current work day and current time, as well as the events recorded that are already passed in the work day, and the events that are upcoming.

## Installation

My development environment was created in Visual Studio Code to write and correct my code, while simultanenously running the program live through the browser via the index.html file to test my code.
Then, deploying my finished code live onto the website will be accessed through my code's URL on Github Pages.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
